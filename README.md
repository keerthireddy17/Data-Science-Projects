<h1 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Housing Price Prediction</h1>

<strong>Background</strong>:

California’s housing market plays a pivotal role for residents, investors, and policymakers. The market’s complexity, driven by economic trends, population growth, and urban development, necessitates a data-driven approach to make informed decisions regarding property investment and policy-making.

<strong>Objective</strong>:

Enhance Data Quality: Improve preprocessing methods to address missing values, transform categorical variables, and apply feature engineering techniques.

Develop Predictive Model: Create a robust regression model to predict median home prices based on location, housing attributes, economic indicators, and demographics.

Evaluate Performance: Use statistical metrics and visualizations to assess the model’s accuracy and compare its performance against alternative models.

<strong>Methods</strong>:

Linear Regression: Utilized for its effectiveness in predicting continuous variables, assuming a linear relationship between features and house prices.

Log Transformation: Applied to stabilize variance and reduce skewness, enhancing model performance.

Variance Inflation Factor (VIF): Used to detect and address multicollinearity among predictor variables.

<strong>Results</strong>:

Median Income: Moderate positive correlation (0.69) with housing prices, indicating higher incomes lead to more expensive homes.

Housing Characteristics: Weak positive correlations with variables such as median age (0.1) and total rooms (0.13), suggesting newer or larger homes may have higher prices.

Location: Weak negative correlations with latitude (-0.14) and longitude (-0.05), implying slight price decreases in certain areas.

Population Density: Weak negative correlation (-0.03), with higher densities potentially correlating with slightly lower home prices.

The regression model demonstrated strong performance with a high R-squared value, significant coefficients, and minimal prediction errors. 
These insights emphasize the importance of considering socioeconomic and geographic factors in housing market analysis, aiding stakeholders in making informed decisions.

<strong>Background:</strong>

This project involved cleaning and preparing data from the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program, sourced from Kaggle. The dataset included various crime statistics across different regions and years, providing a rich source of information for analysis. My role was to clean and preprocess this data to ensure its accuracy and usability for further analysis.

<strong>Objective:</strong>

The primary goal of this project was to transform raw, uncleaned data into a structured and reliable format. This included handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and ensuring data integrity. The cleaned dataset aimed to facilitate accurate and insightful analysis for crime trend evaluation and policy making.

<strong>Skills:</strong>

Data Cleaning: Managed missing data, corrected inconsistencies, and standardized formats.

Data Transformation: Converted data types, merged datasets, and created new features to enhance analysis.

Tools and Technologies: Utilized Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation, and Jupyter Notebooks for documentation and analysis.

<strong>Results:</strong>

- Successfully cleaned and transformed the dataset, reducing the error rate and improving data quality.
- Enhanced dataset usability for subsequent analytical tasks, including trend analysis and predictive modeling.
- Documented the data cleaning process, providing a clear and reproducible methodology for future work.
